1) We abandoned tikzexternalize since it causes more problems than it solves.
Instead there all TiKz figures should go into ./figures/<filename>.tikz and use
the standalone document class (see ./figures/test.tikz for an example). A
subordinate Makefile compiles all figures. If you supply -j <threads>, it will
also compile figures in parallel.
Due to this change it is more important than ever that you include all
additional packages in ./pream/Packages.tex, since this file is included by all
figures in order to get consistent fonts etc.

2) There is currently a known bug ./pream/MathConfiguration.tex (see FIXME). The
temporary fix is to comment the offending package, which is done by default.
