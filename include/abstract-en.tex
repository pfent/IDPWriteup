One of the main problems of email communication is missing encryption.
Existing services to generate email encryption certificates are poorly integrated into organizations and thus poorly
accessible.
At least internal email communication should be encrypted by default, since all requirements for strong cryptography can
easily be met.
To work towards this, we implement a certificate management system in our work and enable it to be tightly integrated
into existing organizational infrastructure.

The main features we implemented in our work are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Port the previous certificate management code, so it can be run on existing infrastructure
    \item Integrate user and certificate management into existing directory services
    \item Automate the user-facing process as much as possible
\end{itemize}

As a result of our work, we now have a functional, pre-release system, which is capable of automatically generating
encryption certificates for TUM's users.
While the system still lacks a generally trusted certificate authority, it works with self-signed certificates and
enables users to use more encryption.
