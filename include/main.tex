\chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:conclusion}
To conclude, we - again - need to emphasize the importance of encrypted communication.
Emails are not encrypted by default and existing infrastructure provides only little automated encryption utilities.

Our major contribution to advance those efforts is a tighter integration into existing infrastructure.
E.g.\ for the situation at TUM, we can provide almost full automation of the certification process, but are still
lacking a trust source.
In theory, all requirements of the DFN Registration Authority are already met, since TUM users are strongly identified
by the identity management.
All TUM associates are required have their identity checked, i.e.\ employees need to show their passport when applying
for a contract and students need to upload a copy of their passport when applying for their program.
No technical reasons are blocking a roll-out of an automatic and universal certificate management system.

Our certificate management system should also generalize very well to arbitrary organizations, since all required
components for integration are commonly used and standardized.
User authentication in the vast majority of organizations is covered by support for LDAP and Active Directories.
Automatic certificate approval be covered by requirements to check identities, that are usually present for health
insurances, either for employees or at the moment of matriculation.
