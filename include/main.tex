\chapter{Future Work}\label{ch:futureWork}

Future work includes actual deployment of the system.
This requires aquisition of an actual certificate authority, that is trusted by clients.

Integration into existing infrastructure at TUM also needs to happen, e.g.\ into the Campusonline instance, which should
allow to run JAVA applications

And last but not least the security of the implementations should be independently audited.
Since this system is critical for users trust and freedom, no corners should be cut.
Focus of this work was not the security of the application and questions like, what fields in users certificates are
allowed, were not answered in this work.
