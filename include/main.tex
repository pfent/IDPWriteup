\chapter{Conclusion}\label{ch:conclusion}
To conclude, we - again - need to emphasize the importance of encrypted communication.
Emails are not encrypted by default and existing infrastructure provides only little automated encryption utilities.

Our major contribution to advance those efforts is a tighter integration into existing infrastructure.
E.g.\ for the situation at TUM, we can provide almost full automation of the certification process, but are still
lacking a trust source.
In theory, all requirements of the DFN Registration Authority are already met, since TUM users are strongly identified
by the identity management.
All TUM associates are required have their identity checked, i.e.\ employees need to show their passport when applying
for a contract and students need to upload a copy of their passport when applying for their program.
No technical reasons are blocking a roll-out of an automatic and universal certificate management system.

Our certificate management system should also generalize very well to arbitrary organizations, since all required
components for integration are commonly used and standardized.
User authentication in the vast majority of organizations is covered by support for LDAP and Active Directories.
Automatic certificate approval be covered by requirements to check identities, that are usually present for health
insurances, either for employees or at the moment of matriculation.

\chapter{Future Work}\label{ch:futureWork}
To successfully implement the results, we and the working group \say{secure email} achieved, there are still a lot of
open tasks.
To finish our work on the certificate management component, an actual deployment of the system needs to happen.
Foundations for a proper long term deployment were layed in our work, but to deploy the actual system,
an actual certificate authority, which is trusted by arbitrary clients needs to be convinced to endorse our system.

Integration into existing infrastructure at TUM would also be desirable, e.g.\ into the CAMPUSonline instance, which
should allow to run Java applications and view the web frontend in a familiar environment.

To convince a certificate authority to trust our system, the security of our implementations should be audited
separately.
Since this system is critical for user's trust and freedom, no corners should be cut.
Our work's focus was not the security of the application and questions like: \say{What fields in users certificates are
allowed?}, were not answered in this work.

Last but not least, substantial work needs to be put into user facing clients.
Even though most clients already support email encryption, configuration is still a hassle, especially for the
non-technical users.
To achieve a true privacy-by-default system, addons, that automatically set-up and configure all email clients should be
developed.
A special hurdle for for future work will be web based email clients, even though they could potentially have the best
privacy-by-default behaviour.
