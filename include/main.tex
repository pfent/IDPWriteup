\chapter{Background \& Related Work}
\section{Background: existing certificate management system}

\section{Related work}
maybe Let's Encrypt?

\chapter{Design}

\section{Database Connection}
currently only mysql, a more generalized approach would be better, e.g. to store data in an oracle database, such as TUM
uses for its TUMonline

Furthermore, mismatches between database schema and java objects are only detected during runtime, which increases
testing overhead. This can be statically checked at compile time, which should decrease bugs and increase developer
productivity

\section{Certificate Exchange}
Currently lacking. Several different methods:
% TODO: cite Valentin Hauner / Beispiel_IDP_2
HKP/SKS for OpenPGP;
LDAP in RFC 4511, 2798 and finally RFC 4519 for the "inetOrgPerson", which contains a "userCertificate";
DANE via the SMIMEA resource record

Most widespread: LDAP, often used in an organization context

\section{REST API}

\chapter{Implementation}

\section{Object Relational Mapper}
static class generation to check matching models at compile time

\section{Dependency Management \& Build system}
unplanned, but needed due to fragile code base, discovered during initial developement
\subsection{Gradle}
\subsection{Project structure}
\subsection{Outdated Dependency Detection} %
via the gradle-versions-plugin
\subsection{Global Dependency Versioning}
previously problems with updating individual dependencies, since mismatched versions of spring etc. can lead to
"ClassNotFoundException"s at runtime.

via ext version definition, which automatically keep the versions in sync
\subsection{Build Process Automation}
automate creation of database schemas and dfncert dependency via gradle tasks

plus automated generation of a lint report, to catch bugs during development (+ fixing currently existing bugs)

\section{Certificate Publishing}
using java openldap. implementation of a RFC 4519 compliant exchange between CMS server and LDAP server
