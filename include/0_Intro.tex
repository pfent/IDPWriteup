\chapter{Introduction}\label{ch:introduction}
Already in 2009 Cavoukian coined the term: \say{Privacy by design}~\cite{cavoukian2009privacy}.
However in many institutions, communication happens mainly via unencrypted email.
This is very problematic, as personal information of users is exposed to many kinds of abuses.

Designing systems, that employ privacy as a "critical enabler of trust and freedoms in our present-day information
society"~\cite{cavoukian2009privacy} should be in the focus of any respected institution.
At TUM, there are some possibilities to encrypt messages between users, however none of them properly apply Cavoukian's
foundational principles.

Any system, that respects the users privacy should have:
\emph{Privacy as the Default Setting}, which is certainly not the case with even the most basic service messages being
unencrypted.
Furthermore, the system should be \emph{User-Centric}.

Since the current systems at TUM fail those principles, the working group \say{secure email} set out to design a email
encryption certificate system, that tries to move the status-quo to a more privacy by default direction.

Within this project, we face several problems:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item How should a user friendly certificate management system look like?
    \item How can we integrate this system in existing workflows to make it as accessible as possible?
    \item How can we manage certificates in an organization?
    \item What challenges are we facing for certificate based authentication on embedded devices?
\end{enumerate}

For this IDP, we decided to split the problem into frontend and backend.
In this document, we try to solve this problem, with a slight focus on issues in the backend.
